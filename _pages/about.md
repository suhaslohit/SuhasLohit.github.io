I am a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at Arizona State University. I work with [Prof. Pavan Turaga](https://pavanturaga.com/) in the Geometric Media Lab. 

I solve research problems in computer vision and computational imaging. I have experience in high-level inference problems like object recognition and detection, action recognition, and inverse problems like compressive sensing and multispectral image fusion. I design algorithms for these applications usually using deep learning and sometimes using cooler tools like Riemannian geometry (thanks [Dr. Dilts](https://infinityplusonemath.wordpress.com/2017/02/18/asteroids-on-a-donut/)).

I have spent wonderful summers at [MERL](http://www.merl.com/), [SRI](https://www.sri.com/), [Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/) and [ISI](https://www.isical.ac.in/)
