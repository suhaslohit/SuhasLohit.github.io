I am a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at Arizona State University. I work with [Prof. Pavan Turaga](https://pavanturaga.com/) in the Geometric Media Lab. 

I solve research problems in computer vision and computational imaging. I have experience in applications like object recognition and detection, action recognition, and inverse problems like compressive sensing and multispectral image fusion. I design algorithms for these problems usually using deep learning and sometimes using fancier tools like Riemannian geometry.
