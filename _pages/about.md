I am a Principal Research Scientist in the Computer Vision group at [MERL](http://www.merl.com/people/slohit). I joined MERL in 2020 after my PhD.

I finished my PhD in Electrical Engineering at Arizona State University in 2019. My PhD advisor was [Prof. Pavan Turaga](https://pavanturaga.com/) in the [Geometric Media Lab](https://pavanturaga.com/geometric-media-lab/).

My main research interests are in deep learning, computer vision and artificial intelligence. I have experience in high-level inference problems like visual reasoning, object detection, action recognition, and inverse problems like image restoration. I design algorithms for these applications primarily using deep learning and sometimes using cooler tools like group theory and Riemannian geometry. 

Recently I have been working on estimating vital signs (like heart rate) directly from videos, detecting objects in lidar scenes, and abstract visual+linguistic reasoning working towards data- and parameter-efficient general intelligence.
