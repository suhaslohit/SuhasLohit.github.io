I am a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at Arizona State University. I work with [Prof. Pavan Turaga](https://pavanturaga.com/) in the Geometric Media Lab. 

I am interested in solving problems in computer vision and computational imaging. I design algorithms for these problems using deep learning and sometimes using fancier tools like Riemannian geometry.
